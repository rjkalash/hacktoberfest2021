# 300. Longest Increasing Subsequence

Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of longest increasing subsequence.

**Note**:

- There may be more than one LIS combination, it is only necessary for you to return the length.
- Your algorithm should run in *O(n<sup>2</sup>)* complexity.
- Could you improve it to *O(n log n)* time complexity?

### Example 1:
```
Input: [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]
Output: 4 
Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [2,3,7,101], therefore the length is 4. 
```
