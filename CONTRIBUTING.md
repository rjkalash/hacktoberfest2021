# Contribution Guidelines

We love your contribution! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Becoming a maintainer
- Adding New Programs of any language you want.
- many more...

## We Develop with Github
We use github to keep code, to track issues and new codes requests, as well as accept pull requests.


## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/rjkalash/hacktoberfest2021/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code


**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)
